# platform_lifecycle (Resource)

Provides a lifecycle resource to manage the lifecycle configuration for a project or globally. The lifecycle defines the ordered stages through which software progresses. See [JFrog documentation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/stages-lifecycle) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# First, create the lifecycle stages
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "dev" {
  name     = "dev"
  category = "promote"
}

resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "qa" {
  name     = "qa"
  category = "promote"
}

# Global lifecycle
# Note: PROD, PR, and COMMIT are system-managed stages and should not be included in promote_stages
resource "platform_lifecycle" "global" {
  promote_stages = [
    platform_lifecycle_stage.dev.name,
    platform_lifecycle_stage.qa.name
  ]
}

# Project-level lifecycle
# Note: Project-scoped stages must be prefixed with project_key
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "project_dev" {
  name        = "my-project-dev"
  project_key = "my-project"
  category    = "promote"
}

resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "project_staging" {
  name        = "my-project-staging"
  project_key = "my-project"
  category    = "promote"
}

resource "platform_lifecycle" "project" {
  project_key = "my-project"
  promote_stages = [
    platform_lifecycle_stage.project_dev.name,
    platform_lifecycle_stage.project_staging.name
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `promote_stages` (List of String) The new, ordered list of stage names that comprise the lifecycle. Global stages, such as PR, COMMIT, and PROD, cannot be modified and should not be included in the request.

### Optional

- `project_key` (String) The project key for which to manage the lifecycle. If not set, manages the global lifecycle.

### Read-Only

- `categories` (Attributes List) An ordered list of lifecycle categories and stages. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--categories))
- `release_stage` (String) Name of the release stage (for example, PROD).

<a id="nestedatt--categories"></a>
### Nested Schema for `categories`

Read-Only:

- `category` (String) The category name (code or promote).
- `stages` (Attributes List) An ordered list of stages within a particular category. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--categories--stages))

<a id="nestedatt--categories--stages"></a>
### Nested Schema for `categories.stages`

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) The stage name (for example, DEV or QA).
- `scope` (String) The scope at which the stage exists (global or project).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Import a global lifecycle
terraform import platform_lifecycle.global ""

# Import a project-level lifecycle
terraform import platform_lifecycle.project my-project
```
