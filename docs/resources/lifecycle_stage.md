# platform_lifecycle_stage (Resource)

Provides a lifecycle stage resource to create and manage lifecycle stages. A lifecycle stage represents a step in the software development lifecycle. See [JFrog documentation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/stages-lifecycle) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Global lifecycle stage
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "dev" {
  name     = "dev"
  category = "promote"
}

# Project-level lifecycle stage
# Note: Project-scoped stage names must be prefixed with the project_key
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "staging" {
  name        = "my-project-staging"
  project_key = "my-project"
  category    = "promote"
}

# Code category stage
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "qa" {
  name        = "my-project-qa"
  project_key = "my-project"
  category    = "code"
}

# Minimal example (category defaults to "promote")
resource "platform_lifecycle_stage" "test" {
  name        = "my-project-test"
  project_key = "my-project"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The unique name of the stage (for example, DEV, QA, PROD). For project-scoped stages, the name must be prefixed with the project_key (e.g., 'bookverse-deploy' if project_key is 'bookverse'). **Important:** Stage names are case-sensitive.

### Optional

- `category` (String) The category of the stage: `none`, `code`, or `promote` (default: `promote`).
- `project_key` (String) [For project-level stages only] The project key associated with the stage.

### Read-Only

- `created` (Number) The timestamp when the stage was created (milliseconds since epoch).
- `modified` (Number) The timestamp when the stage was last modified (milliseconds since epoch).
- `repositories` (Set of String) A list of repository keys assigned to this stage. This is relevant only when the category is `promote`. Repositories are managed by the API and returned in the response. Read-only.
- `scope` (String) The scope of the stage: GLOBAL or PROJECT. This is determined by the API based on whether `project_key` is provided. Read-only.
- `total_repository_count` (Number) The total number of repositories assigned to this stage. Read-only.
- `used_in_lifecycles` (List of String) Lists the project keys that use this stage as part of its lifecycle.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Import a global lifecycle stage
terraform import platform_lifecycle_stage.production PROD

# Import a project-level lifecycle stage
terraform import platform_lifecycle_stage.staging staging-us-east:my-project
```
